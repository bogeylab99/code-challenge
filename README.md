# code-challenge
This is a solution I have created to; 
1.Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade: 
2.Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
3.Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary. 
The solutions for calcutating the netsalary is not 100% accurate due to a problem that i have tried fixing but is not still being fixed
